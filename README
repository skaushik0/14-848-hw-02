-----

This repository is for deploying a simple HTTP server that responds
with a "Hello, World!" message for any request to "/".


FILES

  - hello.go
    HTTP server to respond with the message, complied as a
    static binary.

  - Dockerfile
    To build a lightweight Docker image (just the binary;
    i.e., from "scratch"), to be uploaded to DockerHub [1]
    and deployed on Google Cloud Run and Google Kubernetes
    Engine (GKE).

  - k8s-hello-svc.yaml
    Kubernetes manifest for deploying the application with
    deployment (for the pod), service (as a NodePort) and
    an ingress to be deployed on GKE.

  - images/
    This directory contains relevant screen-shots for the homework.
      (a): jupyter.png [2]
           Running a Jupyter Notebook locally by pulling the Docker
           image for mcr.microsoft.com/mmlspark/release and running
           it as a container on http://localhost:8888.

      (b): gcr.png [3]
           Download the Docker image from DockerHub (which uploaded
           previously), tag and upload it to Google Container Registry.
           Then, deploy the app on Google Cloud Run as a service and
           test the endpoint.

      (c): gke-0{0,1}.png [4][5]
           Create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy the application
           (from the "k8s-hello-svc.yaml" manifest) as an ingress.

  - Makefile
    Helper for building the binary, Docker image and uploading it
    to DockerHub.
